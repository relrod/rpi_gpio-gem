# rpi_gpio-gem

A rubygem for interacting with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

This is verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry loosely based on a
[Python library](https://code.google.com/p/raspberry-gpio-python/) with the
same goal, by Ben Croston.

## Note

**Programs which use this library can now be run as any user that has sudo privileges.**

This is because the code uses sudo and the permissions on `/sys/class/gpio`:

```bash
[root@fedora-arm ~]# ls -la /sys/class/ | grep gpio
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 0 May 29 06:42 gpio
```

# Examples

### Set the pinout mode

The pinout mode can be either the Pi's pin numbers or the Broadcom GPIO
numbers.

```ruby
require 'rpi_gpio'
GPIOPin.pinout_mode = :rpi # use the Pi's pin numbers (default)
the_pin = GPIOPin.new(11, :in) # Pi pin 11 (Broadcom pin 17).

GPIOPin.pinout_mode = :bcm # Use Broadcom's GPIO numbers
the_pin = GPIOPin.new(11, :in) # Broadcom pin 11 (Pi pin 23).
```

### Read from an input pin.

```ruby
require 'rpi_gpio'
the_pin = GPIOPin.new(11, :in)
the_pin.read
```

## Output

### Write to an output pin.

```ruby
require 'rpi_gpio'
the_pin = GPIOPin.new(12, :out)
the_pin.read # Check the current state.
the_pin.activate # Write '1' to the pin.
the_pin.read # Check the current state.
the_pin.deactivate # Write '0' to the pin.
the_pin.read # Check the current state.
```

## Other Public Functions

### Export/unexport a pin at will.

```ruby
require 'rpi_gpio'
the_pin = GPIOPin.new(12, :out) # Defaults to being exported.
the_pin.unexport!
the_pin.export!
```

### Check whether or not the pin *is* exported.
```ruby
require 'rpi_gpio'
the_pin = GPIOPin.new(12, :out) # Defaults to being exported.
the_pin.is_exported? #=> true
the_pin.unexport!
the_pin.is_exported? #=> false
```
